                    <h1>About Us</h1>

                    <p>Established in 2020, Passport was created with planning and travel in mind. We understand that trying to financially plan and coordinate your travel goals is easier
                        said than done. That’s why Passport was created so you can set your budgets,
                        track your savings, and plan your future adventures without
                        the stress.</p>

                    <p>Passport is an all inclusive application that allows you to set your personal
                        budget, your groups budget and share trip logistics together all in one place.</p>

                    <p>Saving for your next big vacation can be stressful, but Passport is here to keep
                        you and your group organized and on track so you don’t miss a thing.</p>
